# Tutorial 8
## Setup stylesheet

Add a `tut8.css` file to your frontend folder. Link it in your html with the following tag:

```javascript
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./tut8.css">
```

## Styling the tweet input
As a demonstration in this tutorial, we will be styling the text input for the tweet and the associated button. Feel free to style the entire page if you'd like!

Using the `border-radius`, `padding`, `color`, `background-size` properties, style the text input to mimic the Twitter input box. It does not have to be 1:1, but try to get it as close as possible. I would suggest you inspect the Twitter input box and use the same properties.

### Flex
Flex box is a layout system that allows you to lay out elements in a flexible manner. It is a way to make your page more responsive. See here to read more about flex box: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/.

Try to use flex box to style the text input and the tweet button on top of each other, with the tweet button on the right and the text input on the left.
