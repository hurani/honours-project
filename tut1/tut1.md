# Tutorial 1

## Installing Node.js

Go here to install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. LTS version is recommended.

Once installed, open up a terminal and type `node -v` and `npm -v` to verify that your installation is working.

`node` is the executable that will run our server-side Javascript files. You can run files as such `node server.js`.

`npm` is the executable that will install our dependencies. It stands for node package manager and it has a lot of popular packages that will prove useful in this course.

To start off for this tutorial, make a file named `tut1.js`.

## Problem 1

Write a function `sumArray` that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers in it.

## Problem 2

Write a function `removeDuplicates` that takes in an array of numbers and remove any duplicate numbers.

## Try it out in the browser

Make a file named `tut1.html` and copy the following code into it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a webpage</h1>
    <script>
      // Paste your code here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Copy all your code from `tut1.js` into the `<script>` tags `tut1.html` then open the file in your browser. Open up the web console (right-click + inspect element) and observe what happens.
